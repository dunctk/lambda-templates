Here are some quick best practices when using **uv** to package and deploy your FastAPI (or any Python) app to AWS Lambda:

* **Isolate environments**

  * Use `uv init` to bootstrap a clean project layout.
  * Keep dev tools (linters, test frameworks, Uvicorn) in a separate `[dependency‑groups.dev]` so they don’t bloat your Lambda bundle.

* **Lock and export precise deps**

  * Always run `uv export --frozen --no-dev` to generate a fully‑pinned `requirements.txt`.
  * This ensures repeatable builds and avoids “it works on my machine” drift.

* **Target the correct platform**

  * When installing into your `packages/` folder, specify `--python-platform x86_64-manylinux2014` (or arm64 if you’re using Graviton).
  * Match the Python minor version (`--python 3.13` for Lambda’s current runtime).

* **Leverage Lambda Layers**

  * Publish your dependency folder as a Layer once, then reference it in multiple functions.
  * Speeds up your CI/CD, since you only re‑upload your app code on changes.

* **Minimize cold starts**

  * Strip `.dist-info` metadata (`--no-installer-metadata`) and compiled bytecode (`--no-compile-bytecode`) to shave off extra bytes.
  * Keep your handler module small—eagerly import only what you need.

* **Automate builds**

  * Script your `uv pip install …`, `uv export …`, and zip steps in a Makefile or CI pipeline.
  * Treat your Lambda zip, or Layer, as a versioned artifact.

* **Test locally**

  * Use `uv dev` (which runs Uvicorn) to validate your FastAPI endpoints and template rendering before packaging.
  * Catch template errors and routing mistakes early.

* **Monitor and iterate**

  * Track your ZIP size and cold‑start times after each deploy.
  * If size grows too much, consider splitting heavy libs into separate Layers or moving to a container image workflow.

These practices will help you build reliable, repeatable, and performant Lambda deployments with **uv**.
